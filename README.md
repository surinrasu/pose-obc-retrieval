# Pose-OBC Retrieval

![](./banner.png)

`pose-obc-retrieval` is a Rust CLI and browser UI for retrieving oracle-bone glyphs from human pose. It trains a compact twin-tower retrieval model that embeds SpinePose style 37-keypoint pose features and raster glyph shape features into the same cosine-search space.

## Usage

The project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for the Rust toolchain and tasks.

```sh
mise trust
mise install

# Download the pose-obc retrieval dataset from Hugging Face
# You may need to login to an hf account with `hf auth login` first
mise run data:pose-obc

# Train the retrieval model and build the glyph embedding index
mise run train:retrieval
mise run index:retrieval

# Search by a dataset sample
SAMPLE=0 mise run search:retrieval

# Start the web UI
mise run serve:retrieval
```

The UI listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Use `ADDR=127.0.0.1:1234`to choose another address.

## Retrieval Workflow

### Train

```sh
mise run train:retrieval -- --epochs 20 --batch-size 32
```

Outputs are written under `runs/retrieval/`:

- `last.mpk`: latest retrieval checkpoint
- `retrieval_config.json`: model dimensions used by the checkpoint
- `retrieval_training_report.json`: per-epoch loss report

For Metal:

```sh
mise run train:retrieval:metal
```

CUDA support will be added later, same applies below.

### Index

```sh
mise run index:retrieval
```

This writes `runs/retrieval/glyph_index.json`. The index stores candidate glyph
metadata plus normalized embeddings, so repeated searches do not need to
re-encode the glyph corpus.

### Search

```sh
SAMPLE=0 mise run search:retrieval
IMAGE=/path/to/query.png mise run search:retrieval
TOP_K=16 SAMPLE=0 mise run search:retrieval
```

### Serve

```sh
mise run serve:retrieval
mise run serve:retrieval:metal
mise run serve:retrieval:live
```

The live mode posts browser camera frames to the local service and returns the
top glyph candidates for each frame.

## Data Layout

The retrieval dataset is expected to contain one or more `persona_*`
directories. Image and glyph files are paired by filename.

```text
data/pose-obc/
  persona_01/
    images/
      0201_u516D.png
    glyphs/
      0201_u516D.png
    poses/
      0201_u516D.json
```

## Pose Model Training

The repository also contains a Lite-HRNet training path for COCO person-keypoint
data with 37-keypoint labels.

```sh
mise run data:coco2017
mise run data:coco2017:generate-pose37
mise run train:coco2017
```

For Metal:

```sh
mise run train:coco2017:metal
```

## Development

```sh
mise run check
mise run test
mise run ci
```

Useful task names:

- `mise run assets:retrieval`: refresh local BeerCSS and Material Symbols assets
- `mise run data:pose-obc`: download the retrieval dataset
- `mise run data:pose-obc:generate-pose`: generate cached SpinePose JSON files
- `mise run train:retrieval`: train the pose/glyph retrieval model
- `mise run index:retrieval`: precompute candidate glyph embeddings
- `mise run serve:retrieval`: run the web UI
